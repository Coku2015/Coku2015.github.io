# From Tech Support to Decision Maker: How Veeam Intelligence Powers IT Strategy



## Those Sleepless Nights in the Data Center

3 AM. Another sleepless night in the data center.

Alerts flash across the screen while your phone buzzes with messages from business teams. It's been three hours of constant bombardment.

"When will the financial system be back online?" "We're going to miss this month's KPIs!" "Why is IT always having problems?"

As you type commands, you're searching for needles in haystacks of system logs. This is the third time this month you've been fighting fires in the dead of night.

Then you think about your daytime work and face a harsh reality:
- 80% of your time handling unexpected emergencies
- Optimization projects keep getting postponed
- Monthly reports that just list data without providing insights
- Business teams still see IT as "computer fixers and cable pluggers"

This is the reality for most IT operations: always fighting fires, rarely finding time to plan for the future.

But that's all about to change with the arrival of the AI era.

## Veeam Intelligence: From Technical Expert to Strategic Advisor

In our previous article, we explored how Veeam Intelligence in VBR acts as your 24/7 technical expert team. But today, we're diving into the bigger transformation that Veeam Intelligence in Veeam ONE brings – **the complete shift from firefighter to strategist**.

If Veeam Intelligence in VBR is the expert that helps you execute technical tasks more elegantly, then Veeam Intelligence in Veeam ONE is the strategic advisor that positions you at the core of enterprise IT decision-making.

### 🎯 Your Personal CIO Assistant

Monday morning. I open Veeam ONE, but instead of immediately checking alarms like usual, I open Veeam Intelligence and start a conversation with my assistant.

**Question:** Good afternoon, assistant. Is there anything I need to pay special attention to in today's operations report?

**Veeam Intelligence Dialogue:**

![Xnip2025-12-01_13-54-03](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/01/MuR59SNdCQEpYGO.png)

**Dialogue Analysis:**
This "CIO's personal assistant" role is remarkably precise. When asked "Is there anything I need to pay special attention to?", it doesn't just list alerts like traditional tools. Instead, it acts like a thoughtful assistant, proactively filtering truly important information from the flood of alerts. It categorizes by severity, marks repetition counts, and provides priority recommendations.

This approach of "You only need to focus on these important items" is exactly what makes an excellent assistant valuable. Even better, it proactively offers CSV/JSON export functionality, recognizing that executives often need data for further reporting or analysis. This mindset of solving immediate problems while preparing for next steps perfectly captures what a true assistant should be – not just completing tasks, but understanding the executive's broader context and needs.

### 🎯 Your IT Director's Think Tank

During the weekly security assessment meeting, there's no need to frantically search through documentation. I open Veeam Intelligence – my think tank.

**Question:** Please help me review the scores in my Veeam Threat Center dashboard, analyze all component scores, then summarize and provide analysis recommendations.

**Veeam Intelligence Dialogue:**

![Xnip2025-12-01_13-59-39](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/01/Hg4t9Fx8ILcC6DO.png)

**Dialogue Analysis:**
Here, Veeam Intelligence transforms into an "IT director's think tank." When directors need to make security assessment decisions, it doesn't just list raw Threat Center scoring data. Instead, it provides strategic interpretation from an advisor's perspective. It understands that directors care about "How serious are these problems?", "Which should be handled first?", and "How do I report this to leadership?" – so it delivers not technical parameters, but risk analysis reports and improvement roadmaps.

The brilliance lies in its ability to operate at the corporate governance level, transforming "technical indicators" into "actionable recommendations" – exactly the communication format executive teams need. This think tank quality of "understanding both technical details and business language" means IT directors no longer work alone, but have a strategic partner available whenever they need it.


### 🎯 Your Personal Data Analyst

VeeamONE reports can be challenging to read – some are completely incomprehensible. I open Veeam Intelligence, my personal data analyst.

**Question:** For this conversation, regardless of what language I use, please respond entirely in Chinese.

For report analysis, simply select the new Deep Data Analysis Agent feature in Veeam Intelligence. The AI assistant automatically displays available system reports. As shown in the image, I select the "Backup Data Details on Repositories" report and let my data analyst interpret it.

**Veeam Intelligence Dialogue:**

![Xnip2025-12-01_14-08-27](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/01/A7efd4z6lnNBOJi.png)

**Dialogue Analysis:**
Here, Veeam Intelligence becomes a "data analyst," demonstrating the professional expertise of a skilled data interpreter. When faced with technical reports, it doesn't just dump raw data. Instead, using the Chinese language the user specified, it interprets the "Backup Data Details on Repositories" report from a professional analyst's perspective.

The remarkable part is how it transforms boring technical metrics into meaningful business insights – identifying optimization opportunities from storage utilization, analyzing cost-saving potential from backup frequency. This ability to "extract value from data" is exactly what distinguishes senior analysts.

Even better, it provides contextual memory, continuing the conversation in Chinese as requested. This professional service awareness and personalization makes users feel like they have an exclusive data analyst, not just interacting with a cold system.


### 🎯 Your External Security Consultant

Overwhelmed by system security compliance requirements and unsure how to start strengthening your backup system? Open Veeam Intelligence – your free external security consultant is here.

**Question:** Please help me analyze the platform security compliance scores in Veeam Threat Center. For any areas that don't meet security requirements, please explain them in detail. I need you to tell me why these should be implemented and how to fix them.

**Veeam Intelligence Dialogue:**

![Xnip2025-12-01_14-14-14](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/01/5xAesquORNz2pEv.png)
![Xnip2025-12-01_14-14-37](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/01/6bXB8HNSxEvjr7t.png)

**Dialogue Analysis:**
In this final scenario, Veeam Intelligence takes on the role of "external security consultant" – and a truly high-level one at that. When faced with security compliance requirements, it doesn't just provide "what to do" instructions like typical technical tools. Instead, it explains the business logic and risk considerations behind "why it needs to be done this way" – this is the core value of an excellent consultant.

It not only identifies security vulnerabilities but, more importantly, helps managers understand the business significance behind each security measure. For remediation, it provides not just technical steps but also implementation best practices and risk assessments. This "full-service" professional guidance makes security strengthening no longer blind execution.

The key insight is that it helps IT departments transform security from a passive compliance burden into a proactive protection competitive advantage. This strategic perspective is precisely the true value of enterprise-level security consultants.


## Practical Tips

- **Network ports and access endpoints:** rest-ai.veeam.com, cdn.rest-ai.veeam.com, js.veeam.com
- **Starting new conversations:** Refresh the webpage. Note that your conversation history will disappear with the page refresh. If there's information you need to retain, save it before refreshing.
- **Context setting:** Since Veeam Intelligence can remember previous requirements within a single conversation context, you can set overall requirements for subsequent responses at the beginning. For example: "Regardless of what questions I ask or what language I use, please answer me in Chinese."

## Conclusion: IT Operations, It's Time for an Upgrade

As someone who has been following the Veeam ecosystem for years, I've witnessed the struggles of many technical colleagues.

While writing this article about Veeam ONE Intelligence, I had a profound realization: AI brings not just efficiency improvements to IT operations, but a fundamental redefinition of professional value.

Feedback from frontline technical professionals shows that teams leveraging AI decision support effectively tend to transform faster from "technical implementers" to "business partners." This transformation is particularly crucial in today's digital transformation landscape.

Of course, AI isn't a silver bullet – practical applications still need to align with specific enterprise contexts. But the trend is clear: pure technical capabilities are rapidly becoming commoditized, while business insight and decision support skills are emerging as the new core competencies.

For those following this field, perhaps it's time to consider: how can your skill set better align with the demands of enterprise-level IT decision-making?

This transformation represents both a challenge and an opportunity.
