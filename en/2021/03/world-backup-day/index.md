# Save Your Precious Memories—Right Here, Right Now!


Today's content is refreshingly simple—nothing too technical, just a friendly reminder that's particularly important on this special day of the year. I want to encourage everyone to make a backup, whether for personal or company data. On this annual occasion, taking a moment to back up your data feels especially meaningful.

Because today, March 31st, is World Backup Day.

## Let Me Tell You About This Day

Some of you might not be familiar with this particular celebration. The origin story is quite charming—it all started from an online community. A man named Ismail Jadun came across a Reddit post where someone was expressing deep regret after losing their data. Inspired by this moment, Ismail posted his own message on Reddit, suggesting that March 31st would be perfect—the day before April Fools' Day. His thinking was beautifully practical: backup your data the day before, so you don't become the fool on April 1st.

His initiative struck a chord with internet users in 2011. On March 31st that year, countless people across the internet made pledges to back up their important files and precious memories. More importantly, they committed to spreading the word to friends and family, hoping everyone would have a data backup to protect what matters most.

And so, March 31st became established as this annual reminder. Every year on this day, people across the internet remind each other that if you haven't backed up your data yet, today's the perfect opportunity. Even the simplest copy is better than nothing.

## Now Let's Talk About Backups

What exactly should we back up?

Honestly, there's no fixed requirement here. If you feel your data is important—regardless of what it contains—it's worth backing up. Whether it's a piece of text, a photograph, an audio recording, or a video file, these precious memories might exist on your phone, tablet, laptop, or even an SD card.

Don't forget—today, right now, is the time to make that backup.

Making backups can be incredibly simple. Just remember one principle: the 3-2-1 golden rule of data protection. The most basic approach is to copy your data somewhere else. Copying to a USB drive, external hard drive, or home NAS is all excellent methods. For those who take data security seriously, you might keep multiple copies—and that's a perfect way to practice the golden rule of data protection. It's a straightforward method, but remarkably effective!

However, when our devices start multiplying, especially for tech enthusiasts like myself who serve as the family "CIO" of information technology, backing up data for the entire family becomes more than just a simple copy-paste job. When you're managing various devices and data for every family member, this is where I enthusiastically recommend Veeam Backup Community Edition. It can handle backups for up to 30 laptop devices or 5TB of data.

With this software, you can centrally back up data from all the family laptops—whether they're Windows or Mac systems. This approach is far more convenient than copying everything to external drives manually.

The setup is quite simple, too. Fire up a Workstation virtual machine or set up a Windows 2019 server on a convenient, accessible public cloud. Install Veeam Backup Community Edition, then use the new "Catch All mode Veeam Agent" feature in v11 to generate a client installation package and configuration file. Take these packages to each laptop, install and configure them, and you're ready to start backing up.

Of course, if you feel your household data doesn't require the full Community Edition, you can always use Veeam Agent Free Edition to protect Windows servers—still available for download from the official Veeam website.

And that's today's message. If you haven't backed up yet, seize today to make a copy of your data. Tomorrow, you won't regret it!
